    <h2>Positive Impacts of Sports & Leisure on Wellbeing</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="center-text">Engaging in sports and leisure activities offers holistic benefits for overall wellbeing. Physically, sports provide a comprehensive workout, promoting cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility, while also reducing stress and anxiety through the release of endorphins. Leisure pursuits, such as hobbies and social activities, foster mental and emotional wellness by providing creative outlets for relaxation, promoting social connections, and enhancing a sense of fulfillment and belonging. Additionally, both sports and leisure activities contribute to long-term cognitive health, maintaining cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive decline. By embracing these activities, individuals can achieve a happier, healthier, and more balanced lifestyle.</p>
