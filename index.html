       Welcome to SisterSphere &#128149; Your sanctuary for wellbeing and lifestyle!
       <br> Founded with the vision of creating a supportive and inspiring space for women from all walks of life, we are dedicated to promoting holistic health, personal growth, and vibrant living. We're a passionate team of six from across the UK— Anu, Beverley, Bianca, Charlotte, Nesrin, and Stephanie — dedicated to creating a vibrant community where girls and women can explore and engage in a wide array of activities whilst building connections, from crochet and art to running clubs and book groups.

   <h3> Our Mission:
       <br>
       "Empowering women through connection, creativity, and wellness."
       <div class="white-space"></div>

   </h3>
   <p>At Sistersphere, we believe in the power of community and the importance of nurturing both body and mind. Studies show that engaging in regular activities can reduce stress, improve mood, and boost overall life satisfaction. In fact, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, participating in leisure activities can decrease the risk of depression by 30%. We aim to foster a sense of belonging and sisterhood, encouraging each member to flourish and thrive.<br>
      


       <br>At SisterSphere, we aim to provide a supportive and inspiring environment where women of all ages can discover new passions, build lasting friendships, and enhance their well-being. Whether you're looking to unwind with a creative project, stay active with a running club, or share your love for reading, Sister Sphere has something for everyone.<br>
      
       <p> Our activities are as wide-ranging as they are far-reaching! They include:
           <ul>
               <li>Arts & Crafts &#129526;</li>
